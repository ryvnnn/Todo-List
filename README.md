# Todo-list

This is a online todo list that is set up using Node.js and express for the backend as well as using EJS for the front end. 

Functionality:
- The home page (https://limitless-journey-97718.herokuapp.com/) lists a checklist of items that user can/needs to complete. 
- Once checked, the item automatically deletes itself from the list (and the database).
- If a path is entered to the URL (.../work), then the associated todo list will appear and populate with the associated items.
